# HeadSmash Party
[GGJ 2015 Entry - Theme: What do we do now?](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/headsmash-party)

HeadSmash Party is a game about a metal show/party... And headsmashing... That's it.
Two players have to run and dodge the bizarre "things" that showed up at the party to headsmash each other. Whoerever smashs faster survives. Meanwhile, the band singer will give you instructions, which you have to follow IN REAL LIFE:
- Head Bang while playing
- Play only with your little finger
- Play hopping on one leg
- Play with your other hand on the other player's head
- Swap your hands

This project was developed for the Global Game Jam 2015 at FATEC São Caetano do Sul - São Paulo - Brazil.
We would like to thank the GGJ organizers for the opportunity to show our talent and taste for bloddy weird metal trash headsmashing games.
